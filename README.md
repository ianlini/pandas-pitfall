# Pandas Pitfalls

`pandas` is a popular package in Python.
If you are a data scientist using Python, you definitely are using `pandas`.
However, do you really understand how `pandas` works?
If not, you will have a lot of performance issues.

## Let's start

In [this notebook](demo.ipynb), I will use a simple but magical example to illustrate how `pandas` works.
You will at least understand how to trace the behavior of `pandas` after reading this.
I also have [slides](https://hackmd.io/p/rJkXzTWm7#/) talking about this.

## Run the notebook by yourself

You may want to test by yourself:

1. clone this repository and go into the directory:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ianlini/pandas-pitfall.git
    cd pandas-pitfall
    ```

1. build and execute the Jupyter notebook:

    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

2. click the URL shown on terminal to open Jupyter notebook
3. open `demo.ipynb` using Jupyter notebook
